% My personal tutor Professor Bärbel Finkenstädt and trusted advisor and friend Dr Matthew Leeke alongside my supervisor Professor Graham Cormode have shown consistent support on a personal, professional and academic level throughout my time at the University; for this I owe them great thanks.

% The support of my family and friends has been invaluable throughout this process; especially my mother Katie who has always been unwavering in her support of me in the pursuit of my aspirations.

% I would also like to thank all of the artists and musicians who gave feedback on my work or were featured in the training corpus; without their tireless work the world would be severely lacking in value and beauty. Most notably, the works of \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKsVsEXZXe8}{Ryuichi Sakamoto}, \href{https://music-from-memory.bandcamp.com/track/call-me-2}{Gigi Masin}, \href{https://youtu.be/vveVs8axQRc}{Jónsi and Alex Somers}, \href{https://helloflora.bandcamp.com/track/cecilia-lake}{Jamison Isaak} and \href{https://bvdub.bandcamp.com/track/ember-1}{Brock Van Wey} have shaped my years as an undergraduate and offered a great deal of creative and intellectual stimulation as well as instilling a great appreciation for the world and its inhabitants.

This dissertation investigates deep sequential learning techniques in context of the very complex, human and artistic challenge of musical composition: an application of artificial neural networks that encourages innovation through the implementation of cutting edge research.

Model architectures are devised that exhibit progression in their ability to learn rich temporal and relative harmonic structures, as well as in generating music which is dynamic and conscious of a user-supplied mood or sentiment. To achieve this, models are trained with a generalised representation of digital musical scores incorporating data on analysed sentiment and dynamics.

The models are versatile and performant, such that they compete with and in some cases surpass the current state-of-the-art quantitatively, qualitatively and computationally. New functionality is also implemented such as the incorporation of sentimental input and independence from certain musical characteristics of the training data, e.g. key and genre. This is achieved through the unification of techniques spanning the field of deep learning in order to minimise model complexity whilst maximising effectiveness.

Further work would likely leverage higher-quality datasets as they become available alongside any new developments surrounding artificial neural networks to aid in capturing the long term dependencies present in musical data.
