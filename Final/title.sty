% My personal tutor Professor Bärbel Finkenstädt and trusted advisor and friend Dr Matthew Leeke alongside my supervisor Professor Graham Cormode have shown consistent support on a personal, professional and academic level throughout my time at the University; for this I owe them great thanks.

% The support of my family and friends has been invaluable throughout this process; especially my mother Katie who has always been unwavering in her support of me in the pursuit of my aspirations.

% I would also like to thank all of the artists and musicians who gave feedback on my work or were featured in the training corpus; without their tireless work the world would be severely lacking in value and beauty. Most notably, the works of \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKsVsEXZXe8}{Ryuichi Sakamoto}, \href{https://music-from-memory.bandcamp.com/track/call-me-2}{Gigi Masin}, \href{https://youtu.be/vveVs8axQRc}{Jónsi and Alex Somers}, \href{https://helloflora.bandcamp.com/track/cecilia-lake}{Jamison Isaak} and \href{https://bvdub.bandcamp.com/track/ember-1}{Brock Van Wey} have shaped my years as an undergraduate and offered a great deal of creative and intellectual stimulation as well as instilling a great appreciation for the world and its inhabitants.

This dissertation focusses on the application of deep sequential learning techniques to the very complex, human and artistic challenge of musical composition. Comparisons are drawn between numerous recurrent network variants that were trialled for their effectiveness alongside previous work. The project as a whole highlights significant progress made by this research and similar papers and provides commentary and potential avenues for the work there is still to be done.

The devised model is trained to learn not only temporal and harmonic structures in music, but also to generate music which is dynamic and conscious to some degree of a user-supplied mood or sentiment. To achieve this, the model is trained with a generalised representation of digital musical scores incorporating data on its analysed sentiment and the dynamics present in the piece.

The model is versatile and performant, such that it competes with the current state-of-the-art in comparable environments as well as offering completely new functionality with respect to mood and versatility in its ability to understand the relativity of key in music as well as replicate different genres beyond just classical piano. It does all of this in training times which often undercut the other highly-performing models; through the application and unification of techniques to minimise model complexity whilst maximising effectiveness and applicability to composition. Future work would focus on improving the sentiment analysis part and improving integration with the model to perhaps focus on certain key defined features of the music.
