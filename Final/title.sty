I owe great thanks to my personal tutor Professor Bärbel Finkenstädt, my trusted advisor Dr Matthew Leeke and my supervisor Professor Graham Cormode who have each shown consistent support on a personal, professional and academic level throughout my time at the University.

The support of my family and friends has been invaluable during this process; especially my mother Katie who has always been unwavering in her support of me in the pursuit of my aspirations.

I acknowledge and am grateful for the work of Mu Chen on his DeepSent project which forms the basis for some of the sentiment analysis carried out during this project. Additionally, the correspondence I shared with Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski and Daniel Johnson regarding their evaluation procedures was important in allowing me to compare the results of this project with their research (the work of these researchers is cited in the main body of the report).

Finally, I would like to thank all of the artists and musicians who gave feedback on my work or were featured in the training corpus; without their tireless work the world would be severely lacking in value and beauty. Most notably, the works of \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKsVsEXZXe8}{Ryuichi Sakamoto}, \href{https://music-from-memory.bandcamp.com/track/call-me-2}{Gigi Masin}, \href{https://youtu.be/vveVs8axQRc}{Jónsi and Alex Somers}, \href{https://helloflora.bandcamp.com/track/cecilia-lake}{Jamison Isaak} and \href{https://bvdub.bandcamp.com/track/ember-1}{Brock Van Wey} have shaped my years as an undergraduate and offered a great deal of creative and intellectual stimulation as well as instilling a great appreciation for the world and its people.

This dissertation investigates deep sequential learning techniques in context of the very complex, human and artistic challenge of musical composition: an application of artificial neural networks that encourages innovation through the implementation of cutting-edge research.

Model architectures are devised that exhibit progression in their ability to learn rich temporal and relative harmonic structures, as well as in generating music which is dynamic and conscious of a user-supplied mood or sentiment. To achieve this, models are trained with a generalised representation of digital musical scores incorporating data on analysed sentiment and dynamics.

The models are versatile and performant, such that they compete with and in some cases surpass the current state-of-the-art quantitatively, qualitatively and computationally. New functionality is also implemented such as the incorporation of sentimental input and independence from certain musical characteristics of the training data, e.g. key and genre. This is achieved through the unification of techniques spanning the field of deep learning in order to minimise model complexity whilst maximising effectiveness.

Further work would likely leverage higher-quality datasets as they become available alongside any new developments surrounding artificial neural networks to aid in capturing the long-term dependencies present in musical data.
